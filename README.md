+3 years of programming experience as a frontend developer
I enjoy spending time thinking about how things work and coming up with solutions to problems.
<br/>
I put some pictures of my last project which is related to create and manage your web presence immediately.
<h4>It includes some pages that we can divided into 3 parts:</h4>
1- shop that a user can see the products and add them to cart.<br>
2- profile that shows some personal information about a user.<br>
3- panel which is dedicated to seller to manage the products etc.<br>
I made this project based on Reactjs and also I used these tools inside it:<br/>
<b>antd , axios , context , sass modules</b>
